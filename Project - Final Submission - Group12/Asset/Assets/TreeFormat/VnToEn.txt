Music
The Kinh and all ethnic minorities in Vietnam have a time-honoured tradition of music and dance. This is evidenced by the figures seen dancing to music which were engraved on the bronze drums unearthed at dong Son (Thanh Hoa province) and lithophones discovered in Tay Nguyen Highlands and other relics. Besides royal court music
there was also a rich vein of music which was closely attached to the daily lives of the working masses. Thousands of diverse musical tunes have been collected from this source. From Quan Ho folk songs in the North to Hue songs (songs from the Perfume River)

Pho is the most popular food among the population. Pho is mostly commonly eaten for breakfast
although many other people would have it for their lunch or dinner. anyone feeling hungry in the small hours of the morning can also enjoy a bowl of hot and spicy Pho to fill their empty stomach. Pho also needs its special taste and smell. The grated rice paper is made of the best variety of fragrant rice called Gao Te. The soup for Pho Bo (Pho with beef) is made by stewing the bones of cows and pigs for a long time in a large pot. Pieces of fillet mignon together with several slices of ginger are reserved for a bowl of Pho Bo Tai (rare fillet). Slices of well done meat are however offered to those less keen on eating rare fillets. Meanwhile soup for Pho Ga (Pho with chicken meat) is made by stewing together chicken and pig bones. White chicken meat served with Pho Ga is boneless and cut into thin slices you could regard Pho Bo and Pho Ga as Vietnam's special soup. it has the added advantage of being convenient to prepare and healthy to eat

Cylindrical drum
LeGeNd oF "TRoNG CoM". a famous song from Vietnamese folklore goes thus: "How joyful to have a Trong Com
and it is an honour for those who can clap it skilfully..."The lyrics and the melody are usually accompanied by a picture showing boy or girl drummers with axehead-shaped turbans over their heads and long-shaped drums hung loose from the neck down to about the belly... all these easily mislead the audience to believe that Trong Com (the Vietnamese cylindrical drum) is an ordinary musical instrument. in fact

Tradition
The life style of Vietnamese people is closely attached to their villages and native land. LaNG (village in Vietnamese language) is CHieNG (in Tay-Thai language)
BaN (in Muong language) and BuoN (in languages of several minority groups inhabiting Central Highlands). LaNG is not only an administrative organization but also an economic unit based on sections of land on which farming products are made. Typical village features may be a banyan tree standing at the village front gate (or bamboo groves surrounding the village)

Star apple
upon entering an orchard of star apple trees
visitors can see for themselves hundreds of star apples hanging suspendedly from branches. The round and smooth fruits are of the same size. The shape of the star apple only may as well match the name attached to it let alone its juice as fragrantly sweet
